<h1>About</h1>
<p>Recently, SvelteKit is released in public beta. And we could finally see what Rich Harris called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSfdtmcZ4d0">Futuristic Web Development</a>" is made of. It's always better to learn with project, so I made this little blog with SvelteKit and deployed it on the Github Pages.</p>
<p>The Github repo for this blog is <a href="https://github.com/svelteland/svelte-kit-blog-demo">svelte-kit-blog-demo</a>.</p>
